FindFilm
========

Collects films from different sources and makes them available in a unified, filterable, collection.

The webpage is deployed at http://findfilm.se/ .

# Implementation overview
There is a tiny REST API implemented with PHP. It has two resources, search and films.

There is a parser job, that is run periodically to collect films from different sources. It, as well as the sources, are implemented with Java 8. It uses the API to store its findings.

There is a web application developed with AngularJS and Bootstrap. It uses the API to expose the film database.

# How to build

## Backend
To generate Eclipse projects, do:
 mvn eclipse:eclipse
To create a runnable parser job, do:
 mvn package

## Frontend
You need to download backend packages, like Grunt and Bower, and then use them to build the application. Do it like this:
 npm install
 bower install
 grunt build #Optional

There is a faked API response called films.php.fake that you can use together with 'grunt serve' to do front end development quick and easy.

# How to deploy

## Please dont hack me!
Both backend and front end as well as the API will expect a file at:
 /etc/pleasedonthackme.properties
It will need to contain:
 netflix_email=netflix user email
 netflix_password=netflix user password
 api_film_base= Base of API, like: http://findfilm.local/api
 api_film_secretkey_hash=... Should be: SHA1(secrtetkey+seed)
 api_film_secretkey_seed=...Can be anything, but you need to use it to calculate hash
 api_film_secretkey=... Any secret key
On the server side, you should not store the api_film_sectetkey. Only store it on the client side. And on the client side, dont store hash and seed values. Or store them all everywhere if you are lazy =)

## Parser job
Take a look at
 parser-job/cronjob.sh

## Front end
There are many alternatives...
